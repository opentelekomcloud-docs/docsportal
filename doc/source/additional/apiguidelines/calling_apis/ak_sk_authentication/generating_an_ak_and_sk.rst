   .. note::

      -  Users that are created in IAM without specifying email addresses or mobile numbers only need to enter their login passwords.

      -  MyWorkplace users are not required to enter their login passwords. They can create new access keys without entering verification codes if no email addresses
         or mobile numbers have been specified.

   .. note::

      Keep the AK/SK file confidential to prevent information leakage.
