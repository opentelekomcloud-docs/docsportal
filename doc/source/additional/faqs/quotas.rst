**What Is Quota?**

Quotas are enforced for service resources on the platform to prevent unforeseen spikes in resource usage. Quotas can limit the number or amount of resources
available to users, such as the maximum number of ECSs or EVS disks that can be created.

If the existing resource quota cannot meet your service requirements, you can apply for a higher quota.

**How Do I Apply for a Higher Quota?**

The system does not support online quota adjustment. If you need to adjust a quota, call the hotline or send an email to the customer service mailbox. Customer
