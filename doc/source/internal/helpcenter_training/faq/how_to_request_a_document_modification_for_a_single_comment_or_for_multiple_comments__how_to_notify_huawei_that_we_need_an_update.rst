How to request a document modification (for a single comment or for multiple comments)? How to notify Huawei that we need an update?
====================================================================================================================================

After finishing the review (and raising the comments) you have 3 options how to close the review:

-  **Approve** - PR is being approved and can be moved to the next stage

-  **Comment** - Raising the comments without explicit requirement of any changes (not blocking approval)

-  **Request Changes** - Approval is not given and PR is blocked by requesting the changes which means that PR should receive another commit of changes and only after that PR will be ready for next review round
