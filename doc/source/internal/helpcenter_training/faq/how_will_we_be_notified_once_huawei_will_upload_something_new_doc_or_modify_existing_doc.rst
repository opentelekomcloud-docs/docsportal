How will we be notified once Huawei will upload something (new doc, or modify existing doc)?
============================================================================================

After Huawei creates new PR in doc-exports repository the respective PR is autocreated in target document repository (for example in https://gitea.eco.tsi-dev.otc-service.com/docs/resource-template-service/pulls). QA/UAT or other squad members are also members of the gitea group with defined ownership of the respective service document repositories and they should be automatically notified by email about newly created PRs.
