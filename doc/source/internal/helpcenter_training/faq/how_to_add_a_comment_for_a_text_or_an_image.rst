How to add a comment for a text or an image?
============================================

As natively in Gitea/Github any change in PR can be raised as a comment and can become subject for requesting the change

Adding a comment is a simple thing as described on the following link: `https://gitea.eco.tsi-dev.otc-service.com/docs/docsportal/wiki/Review#adding_comments <https://gitea.eco.tsi-dev.otc-service.com/docs/docsportal/wiki/Review#adding_comments>`_ .

Adding a comment for an image is not possible directly as shown on previous link but can be done simply at Conversation tab.

In case you want to comment something not being subject of change in PR but still valuable to comment (other part of documentation) you can raise an issue for that.
