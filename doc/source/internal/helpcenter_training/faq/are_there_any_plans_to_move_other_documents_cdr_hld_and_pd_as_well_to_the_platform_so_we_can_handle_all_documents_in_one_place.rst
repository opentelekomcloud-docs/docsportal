Are there any plans to move other documents CDR, HLD, and PD as well to the platform so we can handle all documents in one place?
=================================================================================================================================

Yes, the plan for this year is:

-  Start integration of Hybrid Documentation to Help Center 3.0. Kevin Heyong has already confirmed that he initiates the talks to R&D.

-  Start integration of internal Huawei documents to Help Center 3.0 (this will be a bit challenging as this sort of documents are not present in Huawei documentation system and R&D is taking care of them by their own so the only existing source of the documentation is doc word type)
