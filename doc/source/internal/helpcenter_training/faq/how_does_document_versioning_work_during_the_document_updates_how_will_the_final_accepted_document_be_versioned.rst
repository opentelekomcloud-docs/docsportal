How does document versioning work during the document updates? How will the final accepted document be versioned?
=================================================================================================================

One document version can be understood as one documentation PR. Even if in PR there are mutliple commits based on several review iterations at the ends those commits are squashed to a single change and presented as one change in gitea/github. Of course in case of valid reasons Huawei might introduce more version updates directly in change history chapter.
