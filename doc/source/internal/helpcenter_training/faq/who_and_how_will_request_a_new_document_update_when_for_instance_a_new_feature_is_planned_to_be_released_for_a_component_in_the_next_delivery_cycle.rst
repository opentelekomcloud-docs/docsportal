Again multiple way how to request documentation update:

-  as a part of standard JIRA RM process there's task for Huawei (delivery documentation task) with mandatory field Documentation PR link which Huawei need to fill in with gitea link to be able to close the task.

-  as a new issue in https://gitea.eco.tsi-dev.otc-service.com/docs/doc-exports/issues 

-  as a new issue in https://gitea.eco.tsi-dev.otc-service.com/docs/TARGET-SERVICE-NAME/issues 

-  email contact to Huawei R&D from this link: https://confluence.tsi-dev.otc-service.com/display/HUAW/Documentation+Gitops+Rollout+and+Status+page
